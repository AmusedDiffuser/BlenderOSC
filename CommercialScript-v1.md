# Script for a Short Commercial:

## Opening Shot:

[Scene: A young woman is sitting at her computer, working on a 3D physics simulation in Blender. She has a synthesizer and a drum pad on her desk.]

Narrator: 
### Imagine creating 3D animations and soundtracks that are more interactive and dynamic. 
Imagine using any device or program to control your 3D models and your sound. Imagine having...
### the ultimate tools for 3D animation and sound creation!

[Scene: The woman clicks on her computer and several balls start bouncing on a floor in the 3D scene. She hears the synthesizer playing notes that correspond to the balls bouncing in Blender. She turns a knob on her synthesizer and the sound changes. She sees the lighting in the 3D scene changing color as well.]

Narrator: With these tools, you can use any device or program to communicate between Blender and Reaper. You can control any aspect of your 3D models and your sound with ease.

[Scene: The woman taps on her drum pad and the balls in the 3D scene explode into sparks. She hears another sound from her speaker that matches the sparks.]

-----

## Scene Two;

Narrator: You can also use any device or program to make your 3D models and your sound react to each other or to other inputs or outputs.

[Scene: Cut to a different scene. A man is standing in front of a large screen, giving a business presentation. He has a phone in his hand. He shows a 3D visualization of a modern building on the screen.]

Narrator: You can also use any device or program to make your 3D models and your sound more impressive and professional.

[Scene: The man rotates his phone and the 3D visualization on the screen rotates accordingly. He zooms in and out on his phone and the 3D visualization on the screen zooms in and out as well. He impresses his audience with his presentation.]

-----

## Scene Three:

Narrator: You can also use any device or program to make your 3D models and your sound more immersive and realistic.

[Scene: Cut to another different scene. Two scientists are working in a laboratory. They have a hologram projector on their table. They see a hologram of a molecule floating in the air.]

Narrator: You can also use any device or program to make your 3D models and your sound more fun and educational.

[Scene: The scientists adjust a frequency on an oscilloscope. They see the hologram of the molecule changing shape and color according to the frequency. They hear a sound coming from a speaker that matches the frequency as well.]

-----

## Scene Four:

Narrator: You can also use any device or program to make your 3D models and your sound more creative and expressive.

[Scene: Cut to another different scene. A young man is standing on a stage, performing a live music show with his band. He sees a 3D visualization of his music on a large screen behind him.]

Narrator: You can also use any device or program to make your 3D models and your sound more fun and creative.

[Scene: The camera zooms out to show the whole venue. We see a sound engineer standing behind the audience, holding a laptop. He watches the show from his laptop screen, which shows the same 3D visualization as the large screen behind the band.]

Narrator: By using these tools, you can explore your creativity and express yourself in new ways. You can have fun and learn new skills.
