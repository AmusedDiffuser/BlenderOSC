Blender and Reaper are both extremely powerful tools for creating amazing audio-visual experiences. Blender is a free and open source 3D creation software that lets you model, animate, render, and more. Reaper is a complete digital audio production application that offers a flexible and efficient workflow for recording, editing, mixing, and mastering. Until now, connecting these two tools was complicated and confusing. You had to deal with technical jargon, manual settings, and complex configurations.

But not anymore! Introducing two new tools that simplify and automate the connection between Blender and Reaper: **BlenderOSC** and **ReaperOSC**. These tools use a common language to communicate between the two applications, making it easy to set up and control your projects. You can use your phone or other devices to send commands and data to Blender or Reaper, or vice versa. You can also use nodes to create logic and interactions with your audio-visual elements.

These tools are powerful, new, unique, creative, empowering, and inspiring. They open up new possibilities for professionals, teachers, scientists, artists, musicians, animators, and anyone who wants to have fun with sound and visuals. You can create immersive and interactive experiences with motion capture, live performance, VR/AR, games, education, art installations, and more. You can experiment with different ways of manipulating 3D data and generating sound effects. You can also collaborate with others and share your projects online.
